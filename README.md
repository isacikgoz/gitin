# gitin

`gitin` is a commit/branch/status explorer for `git`

gitin is a minimalist tool that lets you explore a git repository from the command line. You can search from commits, inspect individual files and changes in the commits. It is an alternative and interactive way to explore the commit history. Also, you can explore your current state by investigating diffs, stage your changes and commit them.
